# Statistics-During-Idle-Time
An experiment about detecting correlations and feature importances (Python and R).
CERN has proposed that one could utilize idle computer capacity by simulating particles.  CERN has public data for that.  I think that the idea could be more general, if somebody has real data to use in data mining.
I familiarized myself to some Python routines to look for correlations and other dependencies and made some sketch about medical data mining.  However, I have not looked for the best methods or fitted models well since I have no real data.  Now I also have studied R a bit and added a file where statistics are made using R.
The data file included is artificial and too small, just done for testing the software.  It only contains a few examples about both known and hidden things that may or may not have an effect on risks of specific diseases.
