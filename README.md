# Statistics-During-Idle-Time
An experiment about detecting correlations and feature importances.
CERN has proposed that one could utilize idle computer capacity by simulating particles.  CERN has public data for that.  I think that the idea could be more general, if somebody has real data to use in data mining.
I familiarized myself to some Python routines to look for correlations and other dependencies and made some sketch about medical data mining.  However, I have not looked for the best methods or fitted models well since I have no real data.  If I had, I would probably exprore R-methods.
The data file included is artificial and too small, just done for testing the software.  It only contains a few examples about both known and hidden things that may or may not have an effect on risks of specific diseases.
